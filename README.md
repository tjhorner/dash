This is a dashboard I created for personal use, built with Go and React. Itt shows things that are relevant to me throughout the day, and it's meant to be displayed on a 16:9 TV, which is why the UI is so big.

Feel free to use and extend it. I added some tooling to hopefully make things more straightforward. If you are familiar with `make` and `npm`, it should be pretty easy. More documentation will come soon if I remember to add it.
